# Readlist

Readlist is a tool to have a unified and sorted reading list, to help you organising your reading material and staying
on top of the common information overload that we experience online and offline.

In Readlist you can track online or offline articles, books, newspapers, etc. You can mark something as "reading" so
that you always now what to finish first and stop forgetting half read materials.

Ordering by importance and timeliness is very important, so that you can stay on top of new stuff before it gets old
but you also keep track of the important books that you should read.

Syncronisation with Pocket and Trello will allow adaptation to current common tools to keep track of reading materials,
but that are not unified in a single place where information is easy to access.

Archiving all read material will also allow to create a repository of all read material allowing faster and easier
search.

## Development

The development is planned in the [features](doc/features.md) file.
