## Add item

As the user I want to add an item to a list.

I open the page to add an item, I select the list, I type in the name of the item, I submit the form.

I expect to see the list of the items with my new item at the bottom.

## Add item from Pocket

As the user I want to add an item with Pocket, and keep them in sync.

I add an item in Pocket. I expect to see the item in Readlist, at the bottom of the list.

I mark the item as read in Pocket/Readlist. I expect to find the same item marked as read in Readlist/Pocket.

I unmark the item as read in Pocket/Readlist. I expect to find the same item unmarked as read in Readlist/Pocket.
